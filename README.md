# Task_15-AutoVertexCollapse

### Expand react-planner features by implementing auto vertex collpse on straight walls/lines

- at present state every mouse click has a cosequences with inserting the vertex
- we are looking for functionality of collapsing/removing exceeding number of vertices if not needed.
- removing vertices should happen automatically when straight wall/line consist of more then two vertices.
- colapsing should work on wall creation, as well as on shifting vertices (from an angle into straight line)
- colapse functionality should work wit removing cossing wall as well
